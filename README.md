# Concept

NANO focuses on improving the overall quality of software, By focusing on the fundamentals of developing software.

## Stability

Test driven development and running. 

Current testing frameworks focus on just executing developed tests. This introduces exponensial increased development effort.

Fullstack testing is at the core of NANO. At every stage code is run in test mode. This will not just notify the author of the running program, But will also notify all responsible for individual pieces of code. By comparing results of individual functions at every layer.

## Optimization

For most languages it is required to include full size libraries. These libraries come with the large drawback that it requires all consumers to include never used code. This especially impacts languages that do not use any type of building. Most of these languages only have access to compression libraries. This causes an incredible amount of overhead especially for web development.
